```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here we will bring in a fake data frame
```{r}
source(here::here("R", "fake_student_df.R"))
```

Let's look at the data frame with the function View
```{r}
View(fake_student_df)
```

```{r}
fake_student_df_clean <- fake_student_df
  
```
