```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here we will bring in a fake data frame
```{r}
source(here::here("R", "fake_student_df.R"))
```

Let's look at the data frame with the function View
```{r}
View(fake_student_df)
```

```{r}
fake_student_df_clean <- fake_student_df %>% 
  filter(gender_code == "F") %>% 
  select(student_id, first_name, last_name, gender_code) %>% 
  mutate(full_name = paste(first_name, last_name, sep = " ")) %>% 
  mutate(gender_desc = case_when(
    gender_code == "F" ~ "female",
    gender_code == "M" ~ "male",
    is.na(gender_code) ~ "unknown")) %>% 
  select(student_id, full_name)
  
```
